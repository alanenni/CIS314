"""The Number Guessing Game
The goals were to make a game where the user has to guess a number and it gets progressively harder
the project asks the user for a difficulty level then based on that a function creates a number for the user to remember
and a time for the user to have for the guess, after the user remembers the number 3 times the difficulty increases"""
